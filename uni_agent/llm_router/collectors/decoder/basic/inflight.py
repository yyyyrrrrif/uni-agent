"""InflightDecoder — Balancer callback → MetricsUpdate deltas (inflight ±1).

Also dispatch/complete counts, dispatch turn, and dispatched prompt length.

Mirrors verl ``GlobalRequestLoadBalancer._inflight_requests``: acquire bumps
the chosen replica's in-flight count by +1, release decrements it by -1. The
decoder is stateless — it emits only signed deltas; the store's ``incr`` owns
the running counters.

Beyond the running inflight gauge, acquire/release also bump the per-replica
cumulative DISPATCHED_COUNT / COMPLETED_COUNT counters — the monotonic
siblings of the gauge that carry dispatch / completion volume per replica.
Summed across replicas they give the global dispatched/completed totals; their
ratio is the realized-throughput share. On acquire the decoder also forwards
``request_id``: the collector uses it to bump the per-request turn counter
(``PerRequestStore``) and add that turn to the receiving replica's in-flight
turn sum (``INFLIGHT_TURN_SUM``); release forwards ``request_id`` too so the
same turn is subtracted, keeping the sum balanced — the per-replica view and
the turn-weighted view share the inflight collector's home (one callback
subscription, one decode pass). On
acquire the request's input prompt length (``event.prompt_len``) is also
forwarded as a ``PROMPT_LEN_SUM`` delta — the per-replica cumulative
request-size signal the plot derives an average dispatched prompt length from.

``INFLIGHT_TOKENS`` is the token-weighted sibling of the inflight gauge: acquire
adds the request's ``prompt_len`` and release subtracts it. acquire/release run
in the same ``generate()`` scope and see the same ``prompt_ids``, so the balancer
forwards the identical ``prompt_len`` on both — the gauge is symmetric and needs
no request→len bookkeeping in the store.

Event → delta mapping:
- ``on_acquire`` → ``INFLIGHT_COUNT``/``DISPATCHED_COUNT`` +1,
  ``INFLIGHT_TOKENS``/``PROMPT_LEN_SUM`` +``prompt_len``, carrying ``request_id``.
- ``on_release`` → ``INFLIGHT_COUNT`` -1, ``INFLIGHT_TOKENS`` -``prompt_len``,
  ``COMPLETED_COUNT`` +1, carrying ``request_id``.

``on_servers_removed`` is intentionally a no-op (returns ``None``): verl never
removes servers and maintains ``_inflight_requests`` purely via symmetric
acquire/release. Clearing on removal would be unsafe — in-flight requests for
a removed replica still complete and fire their ``on_release`` (-1), which
would drive the counter negative if we'd zeroed it on removal. The cumulative
counts are likewise left intact (they are lifetime totals). Faithful
simulation = don't touch the counters on removal.
