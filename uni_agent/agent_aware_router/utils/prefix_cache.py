    Read-only counterpart of :func:`resolve_prefix_hashes`: the acquire-time
    hashing memoizes the block-hash list in the per-request store and never
    deletes it (later turns hash incrementally off it), so a release event —
    which carries no prompt under verl #7115 — can recover exactly the blocks
    the request pinned without re-hashing and without new memory.

    Returns ``None`` when nothing was ever memoized (no ``request_id``, block
    size unknown at acquire, or the per-request row was evicted); callers
    treat that as "the block list is unknown", not as "the request held
    nothing".
