"""CallbackTransport — Balancer callback transport (pure forwarder).

The network transports (HTTP/ZMQ) fetch data off the wire on a background
event loop. The Balancer's sticky/inflight state, by contrast, is produced by
its OWN request-path callbacks (``on_acquire`` / ``on_release`` /
``on_servers_removed``) — there is nothing to poll. ``CallbackTransport`` is
the isomorphic Transport for that source: ``is_async = False``, ``subscribe``
merely registers synchronous callbacks on the Balancer and returns, and
``stop`` unregisters them. It carries no domain logic — it packs each Balancer
callback into a ``StatisticEvent`` (see below) and forwards it to the handler.

    """Packed Balancer callback — the payload the callback transport delivers.

    The three Balancer hook points do not share a stable ``node_id`` and differ
    in arity, so they cannot be forced into ``(raw, node_id)``:

    - ``on_acquire(request_id, chosen, prompt_ids)``  → two strings + a token list
    - ``on_release(server_id, request_id)``           → string + optional id
    - ``on_servers_removed(ids)``                     → list[str], not bytes/str

    Attributes:
        event: Hook name — ``"on_acquire"`` / ``"on_release"`` /
            ``"on_servers_removed"``.
        request_id: The routing request id (set on ``on_acquire`` and ``on_release``).
        replica_id: The chosen replica (``on_acquire``) or the released server
            (``on_release``) — unified under one field so one parser can treat
            both as "the replica this event is about".
        server_ids: Removed server ids (``on_servers_removed``).
        prompt_len: Input prompt length (``len(prompt_ids)``; 0 when no prompt
            was forwarded). Set on ``on_acquire`` only — verl #7115 releases
            carry no token list, so the release-side token-gauge subtraction is
            folded by the collector from acquire-time per-request bookkeeping,
            not from this event.
        prompt_ids: The acquiring request's input token ids (empty when the
            caller forwarded none). Kept alongside ``prompt_len`` because the
            in-flight token gauge books only the *uncached* part of the prompt,
            and only the collector — which owns the KV store — can tell how much
            of this prompt the chosen replica already caches. Set on
            ``on_acquire`` only, same as ``prompt_len``.
