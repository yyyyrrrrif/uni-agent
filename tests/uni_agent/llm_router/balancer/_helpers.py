"""Helpers for balancer unit tests.

Defines ``_FakeCollectorManager`` (real statistic collectors + stubbed network
collectors) and helper functions. Patching is done by ``conftest.py`` via a
session-scoped autouse fixture (``_conditional_patch``) that only fires when
balancer ut tests are selected, so it never leaks to Ray workers in other test
directories.
