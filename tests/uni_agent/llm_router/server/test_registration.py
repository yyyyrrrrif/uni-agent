"""KvEvents mounting: the ``vllm`` backend is overridden, the name stays stock.

Two invariants: (1) the dynamic ``RolloutReplicaRegistry`` maps ``vllm`` to
KvEventsReplica after import, and (2) every *name-based* lookup that runs in
other processes keeps resolving verl's own vLLM entries — the static
``_ROLLOUT_REGISTRY`` used by ``CheckpointEngineWorker`` Ray actors (a new
registered name would crash there: driver-side registrations can't reach actor
processes), and ``ServerAdapter``'s actor-name lookup, which rebuilds the name
from ``rollout.name`` (so the replica must NOT change the name prefix).
